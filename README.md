### FAQ
Q: A wildcard '*' cannot be used in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header when the credentials flag is true. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
A: Easiest way - search on your project by string 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', find it, and replace * to your domain name (in case of local dev server). Don't forget to restart socket server. 
 

### Todo
